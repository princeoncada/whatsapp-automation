### Short Project Overview:
This is a Dockerized WhatsApp bot API created using Puppeteer and Express. <br>
Current Functionalities Include: 
- Setting WhatsApp Sender
- Sending a message using set WhatsApp Sender

### Current Status:
The project is already functioning but only within local development. I have intentions of deploying it initially in Render, however, due to limitations on Render's free tier, I have opted to proceed with using AWS
### Current Goal:
Currently, I am learning other JS Frameworks like React, etc. Once I get the core concepts of these other frameworks, I will proceed to learning AWS (Amazon Web Services).
